# Runbook: Installation

Deploy the daemon, the systemd user service, and the root-owned hidraw gate into their
live locations.

## Preconditions

- A modern Linux desktop with a **user systemd session** and a StatusNotifierItem tray.
- Runtime packages present: `python3-evdev`, `python3-dbus` (`dbus-python`),
  `python3-gi` (PyGObject).
- Write access to `/dev/uinput` (group membership on most distributions).
- `sudo` rights for the privileged step (installing the helper and sudoers rule).
- The repository checked out locally.

## Steps

```bash
cd controller-manager
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` performs:

1. **User space** (no privileges):
   - `controller-manager.py` → `~/.local/bin/controller-manager.py`
   - `controller-manager.service` → `~/.config/systemd/user/controller-manager.service`
2. **Root space** (asks for a password):
   - `controller-hidraw-gate` → `/usr/local/bin/controller-hidraw-gate` (root, `0755`)
   - `controller-led` → `/usr/local/bin/controller-led` (root, `0755`)
   - `72-controller-manager.rules` → `/etc/udev/rules.d/` (root, `0644`), then
     `udevadm control --reload` — gated hidraw nodes must be born inaccessible
   - `controller-hidraw.sudoers` → `/etc/sudoers.d/controller-hidraw` (root, `0440`)
   - `visudo -c` to validate the sudoers files
3. **Service**: `daemon-reload` and restart, then prints the active state.

Enable autostart with the session:

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now controller-manager.service
```

If Steam is used on the machine, disable **Settings → Controller → PlayStation
controller support** in the Steam client — see
[Steam coexistence](../docs/decisions/steam-coexistence.md) for why and what it costs.

## Verification

```bash
# Service is running
systemctl --user is-active controller-manager.service        # → active

# Privileged helper is in place and root-owned
ls -l /usr/local/bin/controller-hidraw-gate                  # → -rwxr-xr-x root root
sudo visudo -cf /etc/sudoers.d/controller-hidraw             # → parsed OK
```

The tray icon should appear and list connected controllers with their modes. To confirm
the remapping path end to end, follow [verify a remap](verify-remapping.md).

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| `install.sh` aborts at the root step | `sudo` requires a password / is unavailable; run it in an interactive shell |
| Service is `failed` after restart | `journalctl --user -u controller-manager.service -n 30` — usually a missing Python dependency |
| Tray icon never appears | StatusNotifierItem tray host missing — see [troubleshooting](../docs/troubleshooting.md) |
| Remap produces double input | hidraw gate not installed or active — see [the hidraw gate](../docs/decisions/hidraw-gate.md) |

## Rollback

```bash
# Stop and disable the service
systemctl --user disable --now controller-manager.service

# Remove user-space files
rm -f ~/.local/bin/controller-manager.py \
      ~/.config/systemd/user/controller-manager.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload

# Remove root-space files
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/controller-hidraw-gate /etc/sudoers.d/controller-hidraw \
           /etc/udev/rules.d/72-controller-manager.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload
```

The configuration at `~/.config/controller-modes.json` is left in place; delete it too for
a clean slate.
